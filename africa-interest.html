            History
        </h2>
        <p>
            Africa has an incredibly rich history because it is such a vast and varied continent. There are 54 countries in Africa, each with its own tribes, languages, and cultural differences. Apparently, the Omo River Region of South western Ethiopia is a great place to visit to experience traditional culture due to its more than 50 unique tribes. In addition to customs, Africans are one of the biggest contributors to sculptural art, dating back thousands of years. Additionally, there are thousands of indigenous languages and dialects spoken across Africa. Due to colonization, cultures, customs, and even languages such as Creole, English, Portuguese, French, Arabic, and Swahili are spoken.

            Food
        </h2>
        <p>
            Due to a large proportion of the population being farmers, there is incredible, traditional food to be shared. There are outdoor markets to explore and eat at, especially in Eastern, Western, and Southern Africa. Some common foods include couscous, cassava, maize, and plantains. Dishes are rich and can include plenty of legumes, soups, meat, vegetables and fruits.

            Music
        </h2>
        <p>
            African music is a vital part of everyday life in Africa. It is a part of religious ceremonies, festivals, and social rituals. Songs are used for the important events in a person's life (birth, coming of age, marriage, and death). They are used for curing the sick, bringing rain, and religious dances. African music is also highly improvised. A core rhythmic pattern is typically played, with drummers then improvising new patterns over the static original patterns. Traditional music in most of the continent is passed down orally and is not written. Interestingly, African instruments are often made from plants and animal products such as hide and bone. African musicians are very fond of percussion instruments and use a wide variety of drums that are traditionally used as an accompaniment to singing, dancing, working and communicating between villages.
